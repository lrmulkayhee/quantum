# Quantum Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various quantum algorithms used in this research project.

## Available Algorithms

1. **Grover's Algorithm** (`grover.py`): An algorithm for searching an unsorted database or an unstructured list.
2. **Shor's Algorithm** (`shor.py`): An algorithm for integer factorization, which can break RSA encryption.
3. **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)** (`qpe.py`): An algorithm for estimating the phase (eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be executed by running the corresponding Python script. For example, to run Grover's algorithm:

```sh
python grover.py
