    "### Holevo's Theorem and Reversible Computation (1973)\n",
    "Alexander Holevo publishes a paper showing that n qubits can carry more than n classical bits of information, but at most n classical bits are accessible (a result known as \"Holevo's theorem\" or \"Holevo's bound\"). Charles H. Bennett shows that computation can be done reversibly.\n",

    "Roman Stanisław Ingarden, a Polish mathematical physicist, publishes the paper \"Quantum Information Theory\" in Reports on Mathematical Physics, vol. 10, pp. 43–72, 1976 (The paper was submitted in 1975). It is one of the first attempts at creating a quantum information theory, showing that Shannon information theory cannot directly be generalized to the quantum case, but rather that it is possible to construct a quantum information theory, which is a generalization of Shannon's theory, within the formalism of a generalized quantum mechanics of open systems and a generalized concept of observables (the so-called semi-observables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Mechanical Model of a Computer (1980)\n",
    "Paul Benioff describes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer. In this work, Benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of quantum mechanics by describing a Schrödinger equation description of Turing machines, laying a foundation for further work in quantum computing. The paper was submitted in June 1979 and published in April 1980. Yuri Manin briefly motivates the idea of quantum computing. Tommaso Toffoli introduces the reversible Toffoli gate, which (together with initialized ancilla bits) is functionally complete for reversible classical computation.\n",

    "### Conference on the Physics of Computation (1981)\n",
    "At the first Conference on the Physics of Computation, held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in May, Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman give talks on quantum computing. Benioff's talk built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of quantum mechanics. The talk was titled “Quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories: application to Turing machines”. In Feynman's talk, he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer, and he proposed a basic model for a quantum computer.\n",
