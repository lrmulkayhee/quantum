    "### Classical States and Probability Vectors\n",
    "In classical information theory, the state of a system can be described using probability vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical State Set\n",
    "The set of all possible states for a classical bit is called a classical state set, denoted by uppercase sigma. An example of the binary set (or a classical set containing only 0 and 1) is show below.\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}\n",

    "```math\n",
    "\\mathbf{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} p_0 \\\\ p_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where (p_0) is the probability of the bit being in state 0, and ( p_1 ) is the probability of the bit being in state 1. The probabilities must sum to 1.\n",
    "```math\n",
    "p_0 + p_1 = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dirac Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac notation, also known as bra-ket notation, is a standard notation for describing quantum states in the formalism of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kets\n",
    "A ket represents a column vector and is denoted as:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "|\\psi|\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, the standard basis vectors or kets for a qubit are:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "|0> = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "|1> = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bras\n",
    "A bra represents a row vector and is the Hermitian conjugate (complex conjugate transpose) of a ket. It is denoted as:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "<\\psi\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, the bras corresponding to the basis kets are:\n",

    "### Measuring Probability States\n",
    "Measurement in classical information theory involves determining the state of a system based on its probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Measuring a Classical Bit\n",
    "Suppose we observe a classical state (lets call it $\\alpha$) which is part of the set $\\Sigma$ where $\\alpha$ is the first state in $\\Sigma$ so that:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "|\\Sigma| = {\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma,...}.\n",
    "```\n",
    " This changes the probability set of our system (we will call this X) from our viewpoint. We can now say that:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "Pr(X = \\alpha) = 1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```math\n",
    "|\\alpha> = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another example, if a classical bit has a probability vector\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\mathbf{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",
    "```math\n",
    "Pr(X = 0) = 0.75 \n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "Pr(X = 1) = 0.25\n",
    "```\n",
    "then there is a 75% chance of measuring the bit in state 0 or |0> and a 25% chance of measuring it in state 1 or |1> or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "0.75|0> + 0.25 |1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Operations\n",
    "Classical operations manipulate the states of classical bits. Common operations include AND, OR, and NOT gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Classical NOT Gate\n",
    "The NOT gate flips the state of a bit:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{NOT}(0) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{NOT}(1) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Deterministic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic operations are those that produce a specific output for a given input with certainty. In classical computing, these operations are predictable and repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Deterministic AND Gate\n",
    "The AND gate outputs 1 only if both input bits are 1:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{AND}(0,0) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{AND}(0,1) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{AND}(1,0) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{AND}(1,1) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Example: Deterministic OR Gate\n",
    "The OR gate outputs 1 if at least one of the input bits is 1:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{OR}(0,0) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{OR}(0,1) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{OR}(1,0) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "```math\n",
    "{OR}(1,1) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probabilistic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic operations are those where the output is not deterministic but instead follows a probability distribution. These operations can be represented using stochastic matrices, where each entry represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Matrices\n",
    "A stochastic matrix is a square matrix used to describe the transitions of a Markov chain. Each entry \\(P_{ij}\\) in the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from state \\(i\\) to state \\(j\\). The rows of a stochastic matrix sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Stochastic Matrix\n",
    "Consider a system with two states, 0 and 1. A stochastic matrix for this system might look like:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This matrix indicates that there is an 80% chance of staying in state 0 and a 20% chance of transitioning to state 1, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying Probabilistic Operations\n",
    "To apply a probabilistic operation to a probability vector, we multiply the stochastic matrix by the probability vector.\n",
    "##### Example: Applying a Stochastic Matrix\n",
    "If the initial probability vector is:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\mathbf{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ 0.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the new probability vector after applying the stochastic matrix (P) is:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\mathbf{p}' = P \\mathbf{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ 0.4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.68 \\\\ 0.32 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Probabilistic operations can also be applied to classical bits. For example, a probabilistic NOT gate might flip the bit with a certain probability.\n",
    "##### Example: Probabilistic NOT Gate\n",
    "A probabilistic NOT gate might be represented by the following stochastic matrix:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "P_{\\text{NOT}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.1 & 0.9 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This matrix indicates a 90% chance of flipping the bit and a 10% chance of not flipping it.\n",
