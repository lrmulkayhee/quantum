    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits."

    "- To explore new quantum algorithms that can solve complex problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.\n",
    "- To develop and simulate quantum circuits using tools like Qiskit.\n",
    "- To study the theoretical aspects of quantum computing and contribute to the academic community through publications."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- Qiskit\n",
    "- NumPy\n",
    "- Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-computing-research.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Navigate to the project directory:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    cd quantum-computing-research\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Install the required dependencies:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```"

    "### Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement is a phenomenon where quantum particles become interconnected and the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of another, no matter the distance between them."
